Altering the riparian community may affect the health and sustainability of fish and amphibian populations.",

Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere.  In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation"
