Specific areas of the Morgan Group allotments contain altered sagebrush community composition, structure, and function that are affecting sage-grouse and other sagebrush habitat-dependent species.",
        "Upland vegetation and watershed conditions - Livestock grazing is affecting upland vegetation by reducing or removing native vegetation communities that protect watershed soil and hydrologic function. ",
        "Noxious and invasive weeds - Livestock grazing and trailing has the potential to increase or spread noxious and invasive weeds.",
        "Socioeconomic impacts - Livestock grazing affects local and regional socioeconomic activities generated by livestock production.",
        "Wildfire fuels - Livestock grazing has the potential to change vegetation that may affect wildfire.",
        "Climate Change - The issue of climate change and its relationship to the federal action of renewing grazing permits is twofold.  Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere.  In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.",
