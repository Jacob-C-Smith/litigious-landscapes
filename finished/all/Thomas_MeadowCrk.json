Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands, can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.

Livestock numbers and season of use would be at your discretion, within the active AUM use level of 47 AUMs.",

You would be offered a 10-year permit for 47 AUMs.  Grazing would not occur before June 1, and would be delayed until at least July 16 every third year to reduce the frequency of grazing during the active growth period.

You would be offered a 10-year permit for 47 AUMs.  Grazing would not occur before June 1, and would be delayed until at least July 16 in 2 out of 3 years to further reduce the frequency grazing during the active growth period, as compared to Alternative 3.",
