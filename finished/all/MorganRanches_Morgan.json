        "Habitat conditions for greater sage-grouse: Sage-grouse habitat health is directly related to upland vegetation and watershed conditions. Some areas of the Morgan Group Allotmentscontain altered sagebrush community composition, structure, and function that affect sage-grouse and other sagebrush habitat-dependent species.  ",
        "Riparian vegetation conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting riparian condition and aquatic habitat by changing the health and composition of riparian vegetation communities. ",
        "Fish and amphibian habitat conditions: Stream, floodplain, wetland, and mesic (moderately moist) habitat conditions are directly related to conditions within the riparian vegetation community. Altering of the riparian community may affect the health and sustainability of fish and amphibian populations.  ",
        "Upland vegetation and watershed conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting upland vegetation by reducing or removing native vegetation communities that protect watershed soil and hydrologic function.  ",
        "Special Status Plant Species: Livestock grazing is adversely affecting special status plants by altering surrounding upland vegetation, habitat and reproduction of individuals.  ",
        "Noxious and invasive weeds: Livestock grazing and trailing has the potential to increase or spread noxious and invasive weeds. ",
        "Livestock trailing: Trailing may adversely affect upland vegetation, soils, weeds and riparian vegetation. ",
        "Socioeconomic impacts: Livestock grazing affects local and regional socioeconomic activities generated by livestock production. ",
        "Wildfire fuels: Livestock grazing has the potential to change vegetation that may affect wildfire. ",
        "Climate Change: The issue of climate change and its relationship to the final federal action of renewing grazing permits is twofold.  Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere.  In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.

    "alternatives": [
        "Alternative 1 would allow a continuation of your current management on the allotments.  The Morgan Allotment would be authorized as described on your existing permit.  Interim terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. District Court in the year 2000 are also included. ",
        "Alternative 2 would authorize livestock grazing consistent with your application.  The management on the Morgan Allotment is based on 82 percent public land, and livestock numbers and active AUMs are from April 1 through July 15 annually not to exceed 23 AUMs or maximum 8 horses, and from March 16 through November 30 annually not to exceed 421 AUMs or maximum of 60 cattle. ",
        "Alternative 3 would utilize deferment, built around the application of resource constraints where there were issues and/or where Standards were not being met.  A three year rotation that incorporates one year of grazing deferment through the herbaceous vegetation active growing season for pastures 1-4 would become a permit Term and Condition. ",
        "The grazing schedules for the Morgan Allotment would include deferment and/or rest under Alternative 4.  Resource constraints were applied where there were issues and/or where Standards were not being met. ",
        "This alternative would result in no grazing during a ten year period for the Morgan Allotment."
