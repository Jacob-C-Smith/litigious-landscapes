        "Consider the two-fold issue of climate change and its relationship to the proposed federal action of renewing grazing permits. Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.",

    "alternatives": [
        "Current Situation The BLM would renew the livestock grazing permit with the same terms and conditions as those in the existing permit, except for the season of use, authorized livestock numbers, and AUMs of active use. Alternative 1 would authorize livestock grazing during a portion of the period of authorized use in the existing permit consistent with recent actual use and at a level equivalent to the maximum actual use reported recently (454 AUMs), livestock management practices that have resulted in current resource conditions on public land within the allotment.",
        "Applicant's Proposed Action BLM would renew the grazing permit in accordance with terms and conditions within the application received. Because no changes to the current permit were requested, cattle grazing would be authorized in the one-pasture allotment from October 1 through February 28, with an active use of 700 AUMs.",
        "BLM would renew the livestock grazing permit with terms and conditions that constrain seasons, intensities, duration, and frequency of grazing use consistent with the pasture-specific constraints specific to resource values including wildlife, vegetation, soils, riparian, and water quality. Cattle grazing would be authorized in the one-pasture allotment between October 1 and December 31, with an active use of 454 AUMs.",
        "BLM would renew the livestock grazing permit with terms and conditions that constrain the frequency of grazing use during critical periods of the year, and limit the intensity and duration of grazing use specific to resource values including wildlife, vegetation, soils, riparian, and water quality that would be more limiting than those under Alternative 3. In addition the alternative would limit grazing impacts to high-value sage-grouse pre-laying/lekking habitats. Cattle grazing would be authorized in the one-pasture allotment between October 15 and December 31, with an active use of 326 AUMs.",
        "No Grazing No grazing would be authorized on public lands within the allotment for a term of 10 years. The application for grazing permit renewal would be denied and no grazing permit would be offered. "
