        "Current Situation: Alternative 1 considered continuation of current livestock management practices as they occurred over the past 10 years. The BLM defined the Current Situation alternative for the purposes of analysis in the EA as that grazing which occurred under the current permit and which led to current conditions on the allotment. In this way, Alternative 1 is linked to the BLMâ€™s description of current conditions on the allotment, as outlined in the Affected Environment sections of the EA. Grazing that has occurred in the Swisher Springs allotment under the current permit has resulted in fewer AUMs used than the authorized levels. At the same time, grazing use in the Swisher FFR allotment has been at authorized levels and Alternative 1 would renew the portion of the grazing permit with no changes to terms and conditions.",
        "Permittee's Application for Permit Renewal: Alternative 2 analyzed the application for permit renewal received from the permittee authorized to graze livestock in the Swisher Springs and Swisher FFR allotments. The application did not request changes to terms and conditions of the current permit. Under Alternative 2, BLM would renew the grazing permit with no changes to terms and conditions. ",
        "Performance-Based Alternative: Alternative 3 starts with the current grazing permit and adds new terms and conditions that constrain the intensity of grazing use in specific ways to improve specific resource conditions for that portion of the permit authorizing use in the Swisher Springs allotment. The new terms and conditions are implemented to improve and maintain the health and vigor of upland perennial herbaceous species, maintain hydrologic function and soil/site stability, meet riparian management objectives, and provide suitable habitats for special status wildlife species, including sage-grouse. Alternative 3 does not change livestock numbers, scheduled beginning and end dates for use of the allotments, pasture rotations, pasture seasons of use, active use AUMs, or other terms and conditions from those in the current permit. Instead, the alternative allows the permittee to work within the established dates and livestock numbers that currently exist, as long as the permittee can ensure that specific targets are met. Alternative 3 would renew the portion of the grazing permit authorizing grazing use in the Swisher FFR allotment with no changes to terms and conditions.",
        "Season-Based Alternative: Alternative 4 seeks to address resource issues on the Swisher Springs allotment by changing when livestock can graze within each pasture of the allotment. Specifically, Alternative 4 establishes new seasons of grazing use that limit adverse impacts from livestock grazing on specific identified resource values present within each pasture. The seasons of use developed by the BLM attempt to do the following: 1) provide more frequent year-long rest or deferment of livestock grazing use to a period outside the active growing season for native perennial bunchgrass species, 2) limit the frequency of disruption and livestock use within sage-grouse breeding habitats, and 3) limit mid-summer grazing use of riparian areas. Application of appropriate seasons of grazing use, resource-specific to each pasture, limits the timing and duration of available grazing in all pastures and results in the overall reduction in levels of authorized grazing use. Alternative 4 would renew the portion of the grazing permit authorizing grazing use in the Swisher FFR allotment with no changes to terms and conditions. ",
        "No Grazing: Alternative 5 removes livestock grazing from the Swisher Springs and Swisher FFR allotments for 10 years, equivalent to the term of a grazing permit. This alternative would allow resources to recover by removing livestock grazing use on the allotment."
