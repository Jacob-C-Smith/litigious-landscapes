        "Current Management: Alternative 1 would carry forward all allotment management, including AUMs (averaged over this period) livestock numbers, seasons of use, grazing systems, terms and conditions, and monitoring, that has occurred in the allotment over the past 10 years. Alternative 1 would authorize 832 AUMs for 381 cattle from 03/01 to 08/24 and 11/12 to 02/28. No new range infrastructure is proposed under this alternative.",
        "Permittee Proposed Action: Alternative 2 is the permittee’s proposal and includes AUMs, season of use, and management strategies, as applied for by the current grazing permit holder. Alternative 2 would authorize 3,744 AUMs for 1,660 cattle from 03/01 to 2/28. No new range infrastructure is proposed under this alternative. ",
        "Vegetative Production: Alternative 3 is based on the most current vegetative production data and the method used for forage allocation in the Jarbidge RMP (see Appendix D of the EA). Alternative 3 also includes adaptive management in the form of Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, Grazing Systems, new or modified range infrastructure, and Monitoring assigned to each pasture and a Response Toolbox if Management Guidelines or Thresholds are exceeded (see Appendix E of the EA). The grazing schedule – in terms of seasons of use, classes of livestock, livestock numbers, and pasture rotations – would be determined annually prior to the start of the grazing season in coordination with the permittee and based on a review of applicable monitoring data. Livestock grazing management would be consistent with the terms and conditions, as well as the Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, and Grazing Systems assigned to each pasture. Alternative 3 would authorize 1,767 AUMs for 811 cattle from 03/01 to 2/28. This alternative includes range infrastructure modifications described in the EA Section 2.5.13. ",
        "Forage Availability and Resource Needs: Alternative 4 incorporates the vegetative production allocations as defined above for Alternative 3, but adjusts AUMs for slope, distance to water, sage-grouse breeding and nesting habitats, and other resource concerns (see Appendix D of the EA). Alternative 4 also includes adaptive management in the form of Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, Grazing Systems, new or modified range infrastructure, and Monitoring assigned to each pasture and a Response Toolbox if Management Guidelines or Thresholds are exceeded (see Appendix E of the EA). The grazing schedule – in terms of seasons of use, classes of livestock, livestock numbers, and pasture rotations – would be determined annually prior to the start of the grazing season in coordination with the permittee and based on a review of applicable monitoring data. Livestock grazing management would be consistent with the terms and conditions, as well as the Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, and Grazing Systems assigned to each pasture. Alternative 4 would authorize 1,574 AUMs for 718 cattle from 03/01 to 2/28. No new range infrastructure is proposed under this alternative. ",
        "Reduced Grazing: Alternative 5 reduces the AUMs and livestock numbers from Alternative 1 (Current Management) by half. Seasons of use and monitoring would be the same as those described for Alternative 1. Alternative 5 would authorize 416 AUMs would be authorized for 191 cattle from 03/01 to 08/24 and 11/12 to 02/28. No new range infrastructure is proposed under this alternative.",
        "No Grazing: Under Alternative 6, no livestock grazing would be authorized on public lands within the allotment for a term of 10 years."
