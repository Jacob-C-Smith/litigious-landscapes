    "issues": [
        "Habitat conditions for greater sage-grouse: Sage-grouse habitat health is directly related to upland vegetation and watershed conditions. Specific areas of the South Mountain Group allotments contain altered sagebrush community composition, structure, and function that are affecting sage-grouse and other sagebrush habitat-dependent species. Other areas in the group are outside of defined sage-grouse habitat. ",
        "Fish and amphibian habitat conditions: Stream, floodplain, wetland, and mesic (moderately moist) habitat conditions are directly related to conditions within the riparian vegetation community. Altering of the riparian community may affect the health and sustainability of fish and amphibian populations.",
        "Soil compaction: Soil compaction from the physical presence of livestock remains a concern with moist soils, especially in areas with shallow and fine-textured soils. The hazard of compaction of wet soils with hoof action of livestock may be present, resulting in a reduction of infiltration and soil moisture holding capacity in fine-textured soils. ",
        "Riparian vegetation conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting riparian condition and aquatic habitat by changing the health and composition of riparian vegetation communities. ",
        "Climate change: The issue of climate change and its relationship to the proposed federal action of renewing grazing permits is twofold. Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stresses the ecosystem’s vegetation.  ",
        "Upland vegetation and watershed conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting upland vegetation by reducing or removing native vegetation communities that protect watershed soil and hydrologic function. ",
        "Special status plant species: Livestock grazing is adversely affecting special status plants by altering surrounding upland vegetation, habitat, and reproduction of individual plants within South Mountain Area allotment. ",
        "Noxious and invasive weeds: Livestock grazing and trailing has the potential to increase or spread noxious and invasive weeds. ",
        "Livestock trailing: Livestock trailing may adversely affect upland vegetation, soils, weeds, and riparian vegetation. ",
        "Cultural resources: Livestock grazing has the potential to damage or displace artifacts and features of a historic property, which may alter the characteristics that qualify it for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. ",
        "Paleontological resources: Livestock grazing has the potential to cause breakage and displacement of fossils. ",
        "Wildfire fuels: Livestock grazing has the potential to change vegetation that may affect wildfire. ",
        "Socioeconomic impacts: Livestock grazing affects local and regional socioeconomic activities generated by livestock production. "

    "alternatives": [
        "Alternative 1 would allow a continuation of current management on the allotments. Larrusea Cattle Co. would be permitted to graze 34 cattle from 8/16 to 10/15 on the Sheep Creek allotment with 68 AUMs.",
        "Alternative 2 would authorize livestock grazing as applied for by Larrusea Cattle Co.  This alternative would permit 34 cattle from 8/16 to 10/15 with 68 AUMs and within a grazing system that would allow 52 cattle from 8/16 to 9/24 with 68 AUMs. The alternative also included terms and conditions that would allow 3 days of flexibility to move all cattle on and off the allotment and flexible livestock numbers as long as AUMs were not exceeded. The application did not include any range development projects.",
        "Alternative 3 would permit grazing of 10 cattle from 5/22 to 11/19 with a maximum level of use up to 68 AUMs. This alternative would also include a 3-year deferred-rotation grazing system with 52 cattle and no more than 40 days of use each year. Livestock numbers may vary in accordance with annual grazing application as long as the permitted use period and active AUMs are not exceeded.",
        "Alternative 4 would permit grazing of 22 cattle from 5/31 to 8/15 with a maximum level of use up to 56 AUMs. The alternative would also include a 3-year grazing system with 55 cattle, no more than 31 days of use, and 1 year of rest. Livestock numbers may vary in accordance with annual grazing application as long as the permitted use period and active AUMs are not exceeded. The season of use was changed and AUMs reduced to provide for faster improvement and further long-term sustainability for riparian. Riparian improvement will directly benefits sage-grouse resources.",
        "Alternative 5 would deny the applications for grazing permit renewal in whole and not authorize grazing for a period of 10 years for the Sheep Creek allotment. The permittees would retain their grazing preference on these allotments, to be reconsidered at the end of the 10-year period."
