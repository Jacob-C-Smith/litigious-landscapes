Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands, can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.

    "alternatives": [
        "Current Situation This alternative would allow a continuation of your current management on the allotment, but would adjust active use down to your reported maximum level of actual use during the period of 2003-2012.  As a result, active use would be reduced from 1,774 to 1,513 AUMs, and livestock numbers would accordingly be reduced to 253 head of cattle, reflecting the use levels that have led to current conditions on the Box T allotment.",
        "Applicant's proposed action This alternative would renew livestock grazing in accordance with your May 29, 2013 grazing application, and would authorize 1,774 active AUMs with a season of use from 6/1 to 11/30.  Typically, pastures 1 and 3 would be used from 6/1 to 7/15, pasture 4 would typically be used from 7/15-11/30, and pasture 2 would be available to use at flexible times throughout the permitted season due to the availability of water from the pipeline in that pasture. Requests for juniper control and authorization to reconstruct projects in the Box T allotment, as applied for, were not included in the analysis of Alternative 2 because they did not meet the purpose and need of the grazing permit renewal actions, as described in the EA, and in the Notes on Proposed Action outlined below.",
        "Under Alternative 3, BLM would renew the livestock grazing permit for use in the Box T allotment with terms and conditions that constrain seasons, intensities, duration, and frequency of grazing use to a degree necessary to meet or make significant progress toward meeting, standards and ORMP objectives within pastures where identified resources are present, and livestock management has been identified as a causal factor for failing to meet standards and objectives.   Authorized active use in the Box T allotment would be reduced from 1,774 AUMs in the existing permit to 736 AUMs.  A grazing rotation schedule would be implemented to defer grazing until after the active growing season a minimum of 1 in 3 years in pastures 1, 3 and 4.  Utilization, stubble height and stream bank alteration criteria would be applied as terms and conditions, limiting the intensity of livestock use when grazing occurs during designated growth periods.",
        "This alternative would defer grazing in 2 years of each 3-year grazing rotation for pastures 1, 3, and 4 to more conservatively manage resources based upon identified land health resource issues.  Under this alternative, 311 AUMs active use would be permitted, which represents a 75 percent reduction from average actual use over the past 10 years.  Pastures 1, 3, and 4 would be deferred in 2 out of 3 years and used in June 1 in 3 years.  Pasture 2 would be used annually 7/1-9/30.",
        "No Grazing  This alternative would not authorize grazing for a period of 10 years for the Box T allotment."
