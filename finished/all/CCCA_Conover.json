        "Current Management: Alternative 1 would carry forward all allotment  management, including average AUMs, livestock numbers, seasons of use, grazing  systems, terms and conditions, and monitoring, that has occurred in the allotment over the  past 10 years. Accordingly, 2,306 AUMs would be authorized on the allotment for 990  cattle from March 1 to July 17, November 1 to January 15, and again from February 11 to  February 28. No new range infrastructure is proposed under this alternative. ",
        "Permittee Proposed Action: Alternative 2 is the permittee’s proposal and  includes AUMs, season of use, management strategies, new or modified range  infrastructure, and allotment or pasture boundary adjustments, as applied for by the  current grazing permit holder. With this, 4,356 AUMs would be authorized for 1,340  cattle from March 1 to February 28.",
        "Vegetative Production: Alternative 3 is based on the most current  vegetative production data and the method used for forage allocation in the Jarbidge  RMP (see Appendix D of the EA). Alternative 3 also includes adaptive management in  the form of Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, Grazing Systems, and  Monitoring assigned to each pasture and a Response Toolbox if Management Guidelines  or Thresholds are exceeded (see Appendix E of the EA). The grazing schedule – in terms  of seasons of use, classes of livestock, livestock numbers, and pasture rotations – would  be determined annually prior to the start of the grazing season in coordination with the  permittee and based on a review of applicable monitoring data. Livestock grazing  management would be consistent with the terms and conditions, as well as the  Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, and Grazing Systems assigned to each  pasture. With this, 4,122 AUMs would be authorized for 1,768 cattle from March 1 to  February 28. This alternative includes range infrastructure modifications described in the  EA, Section 2.5.9.",
        "Forage Availability and Resource Needs: Alternative 4 incorporates the  vegetative production allocations as defined above for Alternative 3, but adjusts AUMs  for slope, distance to water, sage-grouse breeding and nesting habitats, and other resource  concerns (see Appendix D of the EA). Alternative 4 also includes adaptive management   in the form of Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, Grazing Systems, and  Monitoring assigned to each pasture and a Response Toolbox if Management Guidelines  or Thresholds are exceeded (see Appendix E of the EA). The grazing schedule – in terms  of seasons of use, classes of livestock, livestock numbers, and pasture rotations – would  be determined annually prior to the start of the grazing season in coordination with the  permittee and based on a review of applicable monitoring data. Livestock grazing  management would be consistent with the terms and conditions, as well as the  Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, and Grazing Systems assigned to each  pasture. With this, 3,341 AUMs would be authorized for 1,435 cattle from March 1 to  February 28. This alternative includes range infrastructure modifications described in the  EA, Section 2.5.9. ",
        "Reduced Grazing: Alternative 5 reduces the AUMs and livestock numbers  from Alternative 1 (Current Management) by half. Seasons of use, terms and conditions,  management guidelines, and monitoring would be the same as those described for  Alternative 1. Pastures with native sagebrush communities or with known sage-grouse  habitat would be rested from grazing at least one out of every three years. With this,  1,153 AUMs would be authorized on the allotment for 990 cattle from March 1 to July  17, November 1 to January 15, and again from February 11 to February 28. No new  range infrastructure is proposed under this alternative.",
        "No Grazing: Under Alternative 6, no livestock grazing would be authorized on public lands within the allotment for a term of 10 years."
