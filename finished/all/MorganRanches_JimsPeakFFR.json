        "Habitat conditions for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereinafter “sage-grouse”): Sage-grouse habitat health is directly related to upland vegetation and watershed conditions. Specific areas of the Jim’s Peak FFR allotment contain altered sagebrush community composition, structure, and function that are affecting sage-grouse and other sagebrush habitat-dependent species.",
        "Riparian vegetation conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting riparian condition, water quality and aquatic habitat by changing the health and composition of riparian vegetation communities.",
        "Fish and amphibian habitat conditions: Stream, floodplain, wetland, and mesic (moderately moist) habitat conditions are directly related to conditions within the riparian vegetation community. Altering of the riparian community may affect the health and sustainability of fish and amphibian populations.",
        "Upland vegetation and watershed conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting upland vegetation by reducing or removing native vegetation communities that protect watershed soil and hydrologic function.",
        "Special Status Plant Species: Livestock grazing is adversely affecting special status plants by altering surrounding upland vegetation, habitat, and reproduction of individuals. (Not applicable to this allotment).",
        "Noxious and invasive weeds: Livestock grazing and trailing has the potential to increase or spread noxious and invasive weeds.",
        "Livestock trailing: Trailing may adversely affect upland vegetation, soils, weeds and riparian vegetation.",
        "Socioeconomic impacts: Livestock grazing affects local and regional socioeconomic activities generated by livestock production.",
        "Wildfire fuels: Livestock grazing has the potential to change vegetation that may affect wildfire.",
        "Climate Change: The issue of climate change and its relationship to the final Federal action of renewing grazing permits is twofold.  Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation"

The management on the Jim’s Peak FFR allotment is based on 40 percent public land, and the season of use is between June 15 and November 15, with every third year of deferment; as long as total 56 AUMs are not exceeded, cattle number may vary up to maximum 100 head. ",
        "Alternative 3 was not developed for the Jim’s Peak FFR allotment because Alternative 2 addressed resource constraints.",
        "The grazing schedules for the Jim’s Peak FFR allotment would include deferment and/or rest under Alternative 4. The management on the Jim’s Peak FFR allotment is based on 40 percent public land and the season of use is between June 15 and November 15, with every third year of rest; as long as total 54 AUMs are not exceeded, cattle number may vary up to maximum 53 head.
