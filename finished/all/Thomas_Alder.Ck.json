Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands, can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.

        "Current Situation This alternative would allow a continuation of your current management on the allotment, authorizing 60 AUMs from 12/1 to 12/31, with flexibility to use the allotment at your discretion, as described above, under the current grazing authorization section of this decision.  For analysis purposes, it was assumed that the allotment would continue to be used annually during the spring, as reported on recent actual use reports.",
        "Applicant's Proposed Action This alternative would be similar to Alternative 1, although annual indicator criteria would be removed from the permit’s Other Terms and Conditions, and the season of use would be changed to 4/16-6/30 to reflect the season in which you report using the Alder Creek FFR in recent years and consistent with the application received.",
        "Alternative 3 would implement constraints on the season of use for the Alder Creek FFR to reduce impacts to resources, including sage-grouse habitat, redband trout habitat, vegetation, soils, and riparian areas.  Under this alternative, 60 AUMs of forage use would be permitted, and a deferred grazing rotation would be implemented, so that use would be deferred until July 1 at least 1 in 3 years.",
        "This alternative would constrain the season of use more than Alternative 3 to more conservatively manage resources based upon identified rangeland health resource issues.  Under this alternative, 52 AUMs of forage use would be permitted, and a deferred grazing rotation would be implemented, which would limit grazing to 10/1-12/15 in 2 out of 3 years.  Livestock numbers would be limited to 69 head of cattle, as opposed to Alternatives 1-3, which allow livestock numbers at your discretion.",
        "No Grazing   This alternative would not authorize grazing for a period of 10 years for the Alder Creek FFR allotment."
