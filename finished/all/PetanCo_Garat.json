    "alternatives": [
        "Current Situation:  Alternative 1 considered continuation of current livestock management practices as they occurred over the past 10 years.  The BLM defined the Current Situation alternative for the purposes of analysis in the EA as that grazing which occurred under the current permit and which led to current conditions on the allotment.  In this way Alternative 1 is linked to the BLMâ€™s description of current conditions on the allotment as outlined in the Affected Environment sections of the EA.",
        "Permittee's Application for Permit Renewal:  Alternative 2 analyzed the application for permit renewal received from you on November 21, 2011, and includes the permit terms and conditions requested in that application.  This alternative includes a 3-year rest-rotation grazing system for four of the six pastures, flexibility for periodic deferment or rest in the other two pastures, and 22,750 authorized AUMs (an increase of 3,250 AUMs from the current permit, and an increase of 3,880 AUMs when compared to Alternative 1).  This alternative captured your belief that there are additional AUMs available for use on the allotment. Additionally, consistent with the application received, Alternative 2 included starting the grazing season 2 days earlier to allow time to cross pastures within the Garat allotment and arrive at turn-out pastures on the traditional turn-out date, a change in the billing process to allow payment based on actual-use after completing the grazing season, and authorization to graze horses used for livestock management in the allotment at three camp locations.  Although you requested that two wells be re-drilled and modification be made to one fence, those actions were considered but not analyzed in detail within the EA.",
        "Performance-Based Alternative:  Alternative 3 starts with the current grazing permit and adds new terms and conditions that constrain the intensity of grazing use in specific ways to improve specific resource conditions.  The new terms and conditions are implemented to improve and maintain the health and vigor of upland perennial herbaceous species, maintain hydrologic function and soil/site stability, meet riparian management objectives, and provide suitable habitats for special status wildlife species, including sage-grouse.  Alternative 3 does not change livestock numbers, scheduled beginning and end dates for use of the allotments, pasture rotations, pasture seasons of use, active use AUMs, or other terms and conditions from those in the current permit. Instead, the alternative allows the permittee to work within the established dates and livestock numbers that currently exist as terms and conditions of the permit, as long as the permittee can ensure that specific targets are met.",
        "Season-Based Alternative:  Alternative 4 seeks to address resource issues on the allotment by first changing when livestock can graze within each pasture of the allotment. Specifically, Alternative 4 establishes seasons of grazing use that limit adverse impacts from livestock grazing on specific identified resources present within each pasture.  The seasons of use developed by the BLM attempt to do the following:  1) provide more frequent year-long rest or deferment of livestock grazing use to a period outside the active growing season for native perennial bunchgrass species, and 2) limit the frequency of disruption and livestock use within sage-grouse breeding habitats.  BLM developed the seasons of use so that the allotment would make progress toward meeting the Idaho S&Gs and the ORMP objectives. Application of appropriate seasons of grazing use, resource-specific to each pasture, limits the timing and duration of available grazing in all pastures and results in the overall reduction in the level of authorized grazing use by 47 percent as compared to the current permit (and a reduction of 29 percent when compared to the average actual use made between 2002 and 2011).",
        "No Grazing:  Alternative 5 removes livestock grazing from the Garat allotment for 10 years, equivalent to the term of a grazing permit.  This alternative would allow resources to recover by removing livestock grazing use on the allotment. "
