                        <li  >
                            Current Management: Alternative 1 would carry forward all allotment  management, including average AUMs, livestock numbers, seasons of use, grazing  systems, terms and conditions, and monitoring, that has occurred in the allotment over the  past 10 years. With this, 4,369 AUMs would be authorized on the allotment for 1,016  cattle from 03/01 to 02/28 and 44 AUMs would be authorized on the allotment for 15  horses from 07/14 to 11/29 and 12/01 to 02/28. No new range infrastructure is proposed  under this alternative. 
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  >
                            Permittee Proposed Action: Alternative 2 is the permittee’s proposal and  includes AUMs, season of use, management strategies, new or modified range  infrastructure, and allotment or pasture boundary adjustments, as applied for by the  current grazing permit holder. With this, 13,062 AUMs would be authorized for 3,079 cattle from 03/01 to 02/28 and 300 AUMs would be authorized for 25 horses from 03/01  to 02/28. This alternative includes range infrastructure modifications described in the EA,  Section 2.5.8.
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  class="final_decision"  >
                            Vegetative Production: Alternative 3 is based on the most current  vegetative production data and the method used for forage allocation in the Jarbidge  RMP (see Appendix D of the EA). Alternative 3 also includes adaptive management in  the form of Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, Grazing Systems, and  Monitoring assigned to each pasture and a Response Toolbox if Management Guidelines  or Thresholds are exceeded (see Appendix E of the EA). The grazing schedule – in terms  of seasons of use, classes of livestock, livestock numbers, and pasture rotations – would  be determined annually prior to the start of the grazing season in coordination with the  permittee and based on a review of applicable monitoring data. Livestock grazing  management would be consistent with the terms and conditions, as well as the  Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, and Grazing Systems assigned to each  pasture. With this 8,361 AUMs would be authorized for 1,954 cattle from 03/01 to 02/28  and 84 AUMs would be authorized for 29 horses from 03/01 to 02/28. This alternative  includes range infrastructure modifications described in the EA, Section 2.5.8.

                        <li  >
                            Forage Availability and Resource Needs: Alternative 4 incorporates the  vegetative production allocations as defined above for Alternative 3, but adjusts AUMs  for slope, distance to water, sage-grouse breeding and nesting habitats, and other resource  concerns (see Appendix D of the EA). Alternative 4 also includes adaptive management  in the form of Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, Grazing Systems, and  Monitoring assigned to each pasture and a Response Toolbox if Management Guidelines  or Thresholds are exceeded (see Appendix E of the EA). The grazing schedule – in terms  of seasons of use, classes of livestock, livestock numbers, and pasture rotations – would  be determined annually prior to the start of the grazing season in coordination with the  permittee and based on a review of applicable monitoring data. Livestock grazing  management would be consistent with the terms and conditions, as well as the  Objectives, Management Guidelines, Thresholds, and Grazing Systems assigned to each  pasture. With this 6,915 AUMs would be authorized for 1,613 cattle from 03/01 to 02/28  and 70 AUMs would be authorized for 24 horses from 03/01 to 02/28. This alternative  includes range infrastructure modifications described in the EA, Section 2.5.8.

                        <li  >
                            Reduced Grazing: Alternative 5 reduces the AUMs and livestock numbers  from Alternative 1 (Current Management) by half. Seasons of use and monitoring would  be the same as those described for Alternative 1. Pastures with native sagebrush  communities or with known sage-grouse habitat would be rested from grazing at least  one out of every three years. With this 2,185 AUMs would be authorized for 508 cattle  from 03/01 to 02/28 and 22 AUMs would be authorized for 8 horses from 07/14 to 11/29  and 12/01 to 02/28. No new range infrastructure is proposed under this alternative.

                        <li  >
                            No Grazing: Under Alternative 6, no livestock grazing would be authorized on public lands within the allotment for a term of 10 years.
