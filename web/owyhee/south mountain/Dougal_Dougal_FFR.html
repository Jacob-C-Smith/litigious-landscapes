                <h2>Issues</h2>
                <ol>
                    
                    <li> Habitat conditions for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; from this point on referred  to as sage-grouse): Sage-grouse habitat health is directly related to upland vegetation and watershed  conditions. Specific areas of the South Mountain Group allotments contain altered sagebrush  community composition, structure, and function that are affecting sage-grouse and other sagebrush  habitat-dependent species. Other areas in the group are outside of defined sage-grouse habitat. </li>
                    
                    <li> Fish and amphibian habitat conditions: Stream, floodplain, wetland, and mesic (moderately moist)  habitat conditions are directly related to conditions within the riparian vegetation community.  Altering of the riparian community may affect the health and sustainability of fish and amphibian  populations.</li>
                    
                    <li> Soil compaction: Soil compaction from the physical presence of livestock remains a concern with  moist soils, especially in areas with shallow and fine-textured soils. The hazard of compaction of wet  soils with hoof action of livestock may be present, resulting in a reduction of infiltration and soil  moisture holding capacity in fine-textured soils.</li>
                    
                    <li> Riparian vegetation conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting riparian condition and aquatic habitat  by changing the health and composition of riparian vegetation communities.</li>
                    
                    <li> Climate change: The issue of climate change and its relationship to the proposed federal action of  renewing grazing permits is twofold. Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and  methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the  sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in  conjunction with cattle grazing, further stresses the ecosystem’s vegetation.</li>
                    
                    <li> Upland vegetation and watershed conditions: Livestock grazing is affecting upland vegetation by reducing or removing native vegetation communities that protect watershed soil and hydrologic function.</li>
                    
                    <li> Special status plant species: Livestock grazing is adversely affecting special status plants by altering surrounding upland vegetation, habitat, and reproduction of individuals within Dougal FFR and South Dougal allotment.</li>
                    
                    <li> Noxious and invasive weeds: Livestock grazing and trailing has the potential to increase or spread noxious and invasive weeds.</li>
                    
                    <li> Livestock trailing: Livestock trailing may adversely affect upland vegetation, soils, weeds, and riparian vegetation.</li>
                    
                    <li> Cultural resources: Livestock grazing has the potential to damage or displace artifacts and features of a historic property, which may alter the characteristics that qualify it for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.</li>
                    
                    <li> Paleontological resources: Livestock grazing has the potential to cause breakage and displacement of fossils.</li>
                    
                    <li> Wildfire fuels: Livestock grazing has the potential to change vegetation that may affect wildfire.</li>
                    
                    <li> Socioeconomic impacts: Livestock grazing affects local and regional socioeconomic activities generated by livestock production.</li>

                            The BLM would permit 88 cattle from 12/1 to 12/31 on the Dougal FFR allotment with 90 AUMs.   As part of the permit, the number of livestock and season of use on the fenced federal range (FFR) allotment is at your discretion.

                            The BLM would permit 88 cattle from 12/1 to 12/31 with 90 AUMs and would also include a grazing system that would authorize livestock use within pastures 1-7 and 9 with number of livestock and season of use at the permittee’s discretion.  Pasture 8 would be grazed under a 2-year grazing system with a maximum of 45 days of use, with no more than 45 cattle. 
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  >
                            The BLM would permit the number of livestock at your discretion from 3/1 to 2/28 (365 days) with a maximum level of use up to 90 AUMs for the Dougal FFR allotment.  This alternative would also include a 3-year deferred-rotation grazing system with days of use varying from 30 to 365 days for this allotment. 14 Final Decision

                        <li  >
                            The BLM would permit grazing under a 3-year grazing system that calculates the percentage of public land forage in the allotment.  This alternative would permit grazing from 3/1 to 2/28 at 14 percent public land, with a maximum level of use up to 90 AUMs.  The alternative would authorize 5 to 200 cattle with 32 to 152 days of use.
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  >
                            This alternative would deny the applications for grazing permit renewal in whole and not authorize grazing for a period of 10 years for the Dougal FFR allotment. The permittee would retain her grazing preference on these allotments, to be reconsidered for use at the end of the 10-year period.
