Soils  support  appropriate  riparian-wetland species,  allowing  water  movement,  sediment  filtration,  and  water  stor- age. Stream channels are not entrenching.

                                                    Stream channels and floodplains dissipate energy of high water flows and  transport  sediment.  Soils  support  appropriate  riparian-wetland species,  allowing  water  movement,  sediment  filtration,  and  water  stor- age. Stream channels are not entrenching.
