                    <li> Improve upland vegetation plant communities, and in particular, reverse the shift from desirable to undesirable native plant communities.</li>
                    
                    <li> Improve watershed conditions within upland sites.</li>
                    
                    <li> Limit juniper encroachment into shrub-steppe vegetation types.</li>
                    
                    <li> Prevent introduction and spread of noxious and invasive annual species (e.g., cheatgrass).</li>
                    
                    <li> Improve riparian vegetation and stream-bank stability associated with streams and springs/seeps.</li>
                    
                    <li> Protect special status plants and improve the habitats supporting special status plants.</li>
                    
                    <li> Improve wildlife habitats, and habitats necessary to meet objectives for sagebrush-dependent species, including sage-grouse.</li>
                    
                    <li> Consider whether grazing can be used to limit wildfire.</li>
                    
                    <li> Consider the two-fold issue of climate change and its relationship to the proposed federal action of renewing grazing permits. Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.</li>
                    
                    <li> Consider impacts to regional socioeconomic activity generated by livestock production.</li>

                            Current Situation This alternative would allow a continuation of your current management on the allotment, but remove active AUMs that have been in voluntary non-use since 1996.  As a result, active use would be reduced from to 1,351 AUMs, and livestock numbers would accordingly be reduced to 557 head of cattle.  Pastures 1 and 2 would continue to be rested in alternating years, while pasture 3 would be grazed annually from April 21 through June 15.
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  >
                            Applicant&#39;s Proposed Action This alternative would renew livestock grazing in accordance with your May 29, 2013 grazing application, and would authorized 2,365 active AUMs.  A total of 797 head of cattle would be authorized to graze from March 1 through June 1.  Pastures 1 and 2 would continue to be rested in alternating years, while pasture 3 would be grazed annually from April 16 through June 1.
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  >
                            Under Alternative 3, BLM would establish a grazing schedule that would implement season of use constraints based upon the resources present in each pasture.  You would be offered a 10-year permit to graze 353 head of cattle from March 1 through June 1, for a total active use of 1,047 AUMs.  The three pastures would be used in a rest-rotation cycle, so that each pasture is rested once every 3 years.

                        <li  class="final_decision"  >
                            Under Alternative 4, BLM would establish a grazing schedule that would implement additional constraints on use based upon the high-value resources present in the Hart Creek allotment.  You would be offered a 10-year permit to graze 243 head of cattle from April 1 to June 15, for a total active use level of 589 AUMs.  A 3-year rest rotation schedule would be implemented, so that each pasture would be used only once in each 3-year rotation.

                        <li  >
                            No Grazing   This alternative would not authorize grazing for a period of 10 years for the Hart Creek allotment.
