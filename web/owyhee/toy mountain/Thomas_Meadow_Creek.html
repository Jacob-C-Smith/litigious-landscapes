                    <li> Improve upland vegetation plant communities, and in particular, reverse the shift from desirable to undesirable native plant communities.</li>
                    
                    <li> Improve watershed conditions within upland sites. </li>
                    
                    <li> Prevent introduction and spread of noxious and invasive annual species (e.g., cheatgrass). </li>
                    
                    <li> Improve wildlife habitats, and habitats necessary to meet objectives for sagebrush-dependent species, including sage-grouse. </li>
                    
                    <li> Consider whether grazing can be used to limit wildfire. </li>
                    
                    <li> Consider the issue of climate change and its relationship to the proposed federal action of renewing grazing permits. Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands, can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation. </li>
                    
                    <li> Consider impacts to regional socioeconomic activity generated by livestock production.</li>

                            Current Situation This alternative would allow a continuation of your current management on the allotment, allowing season of use and numbers of livestock at your discretion, within the active AUM use level of 47 AUMs.
                        </li>

                            Applicant&#39;s proposed action This alternative would renew livestock grazing in accordance with your May 29, 2013, grazing application, and would authorized 47 active AUMs.  The season of use would be changed to 6/1-12/10, to more accurately reflect the time of year you have been grazing the Meadow Creek FFR allotment.  Livestock numbers and season of use would be at your discretion, within the active AUM use level of 47 AUMs.
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  >
                            Under Alternative 3, BLM would establish a grazing schedule that would implement season of use constraints based upon the resources present on the Meadow Creek FFR allotment.  You would be offered a 10-year permit for 47 AUMs.  Grazing would not occur before June 1, and would be delayed until at least July 16 every third year to reduce the frequency of grazing during the active growth period. 
                        </li>
                    
                        <li  >
                            Under alternative 4, BLM would establish a grazing schedule that would implement additional constraints on use based upon the resources present in each pasture of the Meadow Creek FFR allotment.  You would be offered a 10-year permit for 47 AUMs.  Grazing would not occur before June 1, and would be delayed until at least July 16 in 2 out of 3 years to further reduce the frequency grazing during the active growth period, as compared to Alternative 3.

                            No Grazing  This alternative would not authorize grazing for a period of 10 years for the Meadow Creek FFR Allotment.
