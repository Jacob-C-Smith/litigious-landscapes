                <h2>Issues</h2>
                <ol>
                    
                    <li> Habitat conditions for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereinafter, “sage-grouse”):  Sage-grouse habitat health is directly related to upland vegetation and watershed conditions.  Specific areas of the Bogus Creek FFR and Combination Creek allotments contain altered sagebrush community composition, structure, and function that are affecting sage-grouse and other sagebrush habitat-dependent species. </li>
                    
                    <li> Riparian vegetation conditions:  Livestock grazing is affecting riparian condition and aquatic habitat by changing the health and composition of riparian vegetation communities.</li>
                    
                    <li> Fish and amphibian habitat conditions:  Stream, floodplain, wetland, and mesic (moderately moist) habitat conditions are directly related to conditions within the riparian vegetation community.  Altering of the riparian community may affect the health and sustainability of fish and amphibian populations.</li>
                    
                    <li> Upland vegetation and watershed conditions:  Livestock grazing is affecting upland vegetation by reducing or removing native vegetation communities that protect watershed soil and hydrologic function. </li>
                    
                    <li> Special Status Plant Species:  Livestock grazing is adversely affecting special status plants by altering surrounding upland vegetation, habitat and reproduction of individuals.  While pertinent in some allotments analyzed in the Morgan Group EA, there are no known instances of Special Status Plants on public lands in the Bogus Creek FFR or Combination Creek allotments.</li>
                    
                    <li> Noxious and invasive weeds:  Livestock grazing and trailing has the potential to increase or spread noxious and invasive weeds. </li>
                    
                    <li> Livestock trailing:  Trailing may adversely affect upland vegetation, soils, weeds and riparian vegetation. </li>
                    
                    <li> Socioeconomic impacts:  Livestock grazing may affect local and regional socioeconomic activities generated by livestock production. </li>
                    
                    <li> Wildfire fuels:  Livestock grazing has the potential to change vegetation that may affect wildfire. </li>
                    
                    <li> Climate Change:  The issue of climate change and its relationship to the final federal action of renewing grazing permits is twofold.  Livestock grazing in Owyhee County contributes CO2 and methane emissions to the earth’s atmosphere.  In addition, climate change, itself a stressor on the sagebrush-steppe semi-arid ecosystem found in the Owyhee Uplands can, when found in conjunction with cattle grazing, further stress the ecosystem’s vegetation.   </li>
